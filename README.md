# TS-R1: Enhancing Generalization Ability in Time Series Models with Reinforcement Learning

The emergence of DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated the power of RL (Reinforcement Learning): it can achieve desired results directly through RL without SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning). In this project, we explore using R1's methodology to enhance the capabilities of time series models.
